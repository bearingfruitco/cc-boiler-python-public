I thought my experience with this company was absolutely wonderful. They were
fast they were efficient. They knew what they were doing and more importantly
they helped me when I needed help. Do they make money?, of course they do.
They also take chances where other companies won’t. Thank you AmOne- KD

His quality and friendly service is appreciated.  
His customer service and his number closing of loans should be recognized and
rewarded!  
I had a mortgage brokerage business and managed eight staff that complemented

Employee recognition and rewarding by management provides retention,
