# Security Policy

## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please send an email to: security@bearingfruit.co

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide updates as we work on a fix.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

When using this boilerplate:

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER** commit `.env` files with real values
- Use `.env.example` as a template
- Generate strong, unique secrets for production
- Rotate credentials regularly

### API Keys
- Use separate API keys for development and production
- Implement key rotation procedures
- Monitor API key usage
- Revoke unused keys immediately

### Dependencies
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Run `poetry update` regularly
- Monitor security advisories
- Use `pip-audit` or similar tools

### Code Security
- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use parameterized queries for databases
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow the principle of least privilege

## üîç Security Features

This boilerplate includes:

### Automated Security Checks
```bash
# Run before commits
./scripts/verify-security.sh

# Python-specific security scan
python scripts/security_check.py

# Check dependencies for vulnerabilities
poetry run pip-audit
```

### Built-in Protections
- Environment variable validation
- Secret scanning in pre-commit hooks
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` patterns
- Security-focused documentation

### Secure Defaults
- JWT tokens with proper expiration
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- HTTPS enforcement ready
- CORS configuration templates

## üìã Security Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] All secrets in environment variables
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Dependencies updated
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Authentication configured
- [ ] Authorization rules defined
- [ ] Logging excludes sensitive data
- [ ] Error messages don't leak information
- [ ] Rate limiting configured

## üö® Incident Response

If you discover your credentials have been exposed:

1. **Immediately**:
   - Revoke the exposed credentials
   - Generate new credentials
   - Update all affected systems

2. **Investigate**:
   - Check logs for unauthorized access
   - Review recent commits
   - Audit system access

3. **Remediate**:
   - Remove secrets from git history if needed
   - Update security procedures
   - Notify affected users if applicable
