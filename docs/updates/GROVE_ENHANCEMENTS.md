# Grove-Inspired Enhancements

Based on Sean Grove's "The New Code" talk from OpenAI, we've integrated several enhancements that treat specifications (PRDs) as the primary development artifact.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

Grove's key insight: **80-90% of a programmer's value comes from structured communication, not code**. Code is just a "lossy projection" of the original intent. This aligns perfectly with our PRD-driven development approach.

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. PRD Clarity Linter
**Command**: Automatic on `/prd` operations
**Purpose**: Detect ambiguous language that causes miscommunication

#### What It Does:
- Catches vague terms like "fast", "secure", "optimal"
- Suggests specific, measurable alternatives
- Differentiates between requirements (strict) and background (lenient)

#### Example:
```
⚠️  Line 23: "fast" - Specify concrete performance metrics
   Context: The system should be fast
   Suggestions:
     → Response time < 200ms
     → Page load < 3 seconds
```

### 2. Specification Pattern Library
**Commands**: `/specs extract`, `/specs list`, `/specs apply`
**Purpose**: Learn from successful implementations

#### Features:
- Extracts patterns from completed features
- Tags by type (auth, forms, API, etc.)
- Tracks success metrics
- Enables reuse across projects

#### Example:
```bash
/specs extract --from-feature auth-system
# Creates reusable pattern from your implementation

/specs apply auth-jwt --to new-feature
# Applies proven pattern to new work
```

### 3. PRD Test Generation
**Command**: `/prd generate-tests [feature]`
**Purpose**: Turn acceptance criteria into executable tests

#### Process:
1. Parses PRD acceptance criteria
2. Generates test structure
3. Creates happy path + edge cases
4. Links tests back to PRD sections

#### Example:
PRD: "Users can login with email and password"
Generates: Complete test suite with validation, error handling, etc.

### 4. Implementation Grading
**Command**: `/sv grade --feature [name]`
**Purpose**: Measure how well code matches original PRD

#### Scoring:
- Functional requirements (40%)
- Test coverage (25%)
- Design compliance (15%)
- Performance targets (10%)
- Security requirements (10%)

#### Output:
```
=== IMPLEMENTATION GRADE: B+ (87%) ===
✅ Functional Requirements: 95%
⚠️ Test Coverage: 82%
✅ Design Compliance: 85%
```

## 🔧 Configuration

All Grove enhancements are configurable in `.claude/config.json`:

```json
{
  "grove_enhancements": {
    "prd_linter": {
      "enabled": true,
      "blocking": false
    },
    "pattern_library": {
      "enabled": true,
      "auto_extract": true
    },
    "test_generation": {
      "enabled": true,
      "coverage_target": 0.85
    },
    "implementation_grading": {
      "enabled": true,
      "min_grade": 0.85
    }
  }
}
```

## 💡 Key Insights Applied

### 1. Specifications as Code
- PRDs are versioned, testable, and executable
- They compose like code modules
- They have "unit tests" (acceptance criteria)

### 2. Deliberative Alignment
- Implementation is continuously graded against PRD
- Feedback loops improve alignment
- Quantifiable quality metrics

### 3. Universal Specification Authoring
- PRDs aren't just for PMs
- Every prompt is a "proto-specification"
- Clear communication = effective programming

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Reduced Ambiguity**: Linter catches vague language early
2. **Faster Development**: Reuse proven patterns
3. **Better Testing**: Tests directly from requirements
4. **Objective Quality**: Quantifiable alignment scores
5. **Institutional Knowledge**: Patterns capture what works

## 🚫 What We Didn't Implement

Following our "practical over theoretical" principle:

- **Mandatory PRDs**: Keep flexibility for quick fixes
- **Complex Composition**: Simple pattern reuse only
- **Legal Framework**: Too heavy for most projects
- **Model Training**: Outside our scope

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these to ensure value:
- Time to feature completion
- Bug rate reduction
- Rework frequency
- Developer satisfaction

## 🔗 Integration Points

These enhancements integrate seamlessly with existing commands:
- PRD linting runs automatically
- Patterns extracted during normal workflow
- Tests generated on demand
- Grading during stage validation

## 🎨 The Future

Grove envisions an "Integrated Thought Clarifier" - an IDE that helps clarify thinking. Our PRD linter is a step in this direction, helping developers communicate intent more effectively.

Remember: **The person who communicates most effectively is the most valuable programmer.**
