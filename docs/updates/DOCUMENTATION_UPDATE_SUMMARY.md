# 📋 Documentation Update Summary

## ✅ What We Did

### Simplified Documentation Structure
We consolidated 15+ setup docs into 4 clear guides:
1. **Day 1 Guide** - Step-by-step first day walkthrough
2. **New Project Setup** - Quick 15-minute setup
3. **Existing Project Integration** - Add to current projects  
4. **Daily Workflow** - Exact commands for daily work

### Key Improvements
- **Exact Commands** - Every guide shows the EXACT commands to run
- **Time Estimates** - Know how long each step takes
- **Real Examples** - Build actual features (TODO API on Day 1)
- **Simple Language** - No jargon, just clear steps
- **Decision Trees** - Easy workflow selection

### Removed Duplicates
Cleaned up 12 outdated/duplicate files:
- Multiple "Day 1" guides → One comprehensive guide
- Various setup guides → One clear setup guide
- Different workflow docs → One daily workflow guide
