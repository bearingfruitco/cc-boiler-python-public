## 🆕 Major Updates Since Last Documentation

### 1. **Task Ledger System** (NEW!)
A centralized task tracking system that provides project-wide visibility into all tasks.

#### What's New:

- **Progress tracking**: Real-time progress for each feature
- **Issue linking**: Connects tasks to GitHub issues automatically

#### New Commands:
```bash
/tl or /task-ledger         # View all tasks and progress
/tl view [feature]          # View specific feature tasks
/tl update [feature]        # Update task progress
/tl link [feature] [#issue] # Link tasks to GitHub issue
/tl generate                # Generate ledger from existing tasks
```

#### Updated Commands:
- `/gt [feature]` - Now updates task ledger automatically
- `/pt [feature]` - Updates progress in ledger as tasks complete
- `/fw start [issue]` - Links issue to tasks in ledger
- `/sr` - Shows task ledger summary on resume

- `task-sprint` - Replaced `/ts` with `/tl view`
- `feature-planning` - Added `/tl view` after task generation

### 2. **Branch Management System** (NEW!)
Advanced branch control with safety features and task tracking.

#### New Commands:
```bash
/bs or /branch-status       # Show current branch info
/bsw or /branch-switch      # Switch branches safely
/fs or /feature-status      # Feature-specific status
/sync-main                  # Sync with main branch
```

#### Features:
- Enforces one active branch at a time

```

#### Features:

### 4. **New Quality Commands**

## 📝 Documentation Updates Needed

### Files to Update:

#### 1. **DAY_1_QUICK_START.md**
Add section on Task Ledger:
```markdown
### Understanding Task Tracking
The system now includes a central task ledger that tracks all your work:

```bash
# View all tasks across features
/tl

# After generating tasks
/gt user-auth
# Automatically creates entry in .task-ledger.md

# Check progress anytime
/tl view user-auth
```
```

#### 2. **DAILY_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md**
Update morning routine:
```markdown
### Morning Routine
```bash
/sr                    # Resume context
/tl                    # NEW: View task ledger
/chain ds              # Daily startup (includes ledger)
```
```

#### 3. **COMMAND_REFERENCE_CARD.md**
Add Task Ledger section:
```markdown
## 📋 Task Ledger (NEW!)
```bash
/tl                    # View all tasks
/tl view [feature]     # View specific feature
/tl update [feature]   # Update progress
/tl link [f] [#issue]  # Link to GitHub issue
```
```

## 🔄 Workflow Changes

### Before (Scattered Tasks):
```bash
/gt feature → creates docs/project/features/feature-tasks.md
/ts → checks individual files
/ws → no task visibility
```

### After (Centralized Ledger):
```bash
/gt feature → creates tasks AND updates ledger
/tl → see ALL tasks across project
/ws → includes task summary from ledger
```

## 🚀 Quick Migration Guide

For existing projects:
```bash
# Generate ledger from existing tasks
/tl generate

# View the new consolidated view
/tl

# Continue working as normal - ledger updates automatically
/pt your-feature
```
