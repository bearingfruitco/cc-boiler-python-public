# Workflow Enhancement Update (v2.3.1)

## Smart Auto-Approval for Uninterrupted Workflows

### The Problem We Solved

Remember starting a task, going to check Slack, and coming back to find Claude asking "Can I edit this file?" 

That's now a thing of the past.

### What's New

We've added smart auto-approval that lets safe operations proceed without interruption, while still protecting your production code.

### Auto-Approved Operations

The following operations now proceed automatically:

**Reading Operations:**
- `filesystem:read_file` - Reading any file
- `filesystem:list_directory` - Listing directory contents
- `filesystem:get_file_info` - Getting file metadata
- `filesystem:search_files` - Searching for files
- All other read-only operations

**Test File Modifications:**
- Files in `/tests/`, `/test/`, `/__tests__/` directories
- Files ending in `.test.ts`, `.test.tsx`, `.test.js`, `.test.jsx`
- Files ending in `.spec.ts`, `.spec.tsx`, `.spec.js`, `.spec.jsx`
- Temporary and cache directories

**Safe Commands:**
- `npm test`, `npm run test`
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`
- `jest`, `vitest`, `playwright test`
- `eslint`, `prettier --check`
- `tsc --noEmit`

### Still Protected

Important operations still require your explicit approval:

- ❌ Editing production code files
- ❌ Database operations
- ❌ Git commits and pushes
- ❌ Package installations
- ❌ Environment file modifications
- ❌ Deleting files

### How It Works

The new `00-auto-approve-safe-ops.py` hook runs before any tool use and:

1. Checks if the operation is in the safe list
2. For write operations, verifies the file path is in a test directory
3. For shell commands, ensures they're read-only or test commands
4. Auto-approves if safe, otherwise falls back to normal approval flow

### Benefits

- **Uninterrupted workflow** - Start a task and come back to completed work
- **Faster development** - No waiting for read operations
- **Test-driven development** - Test files can be modified freely
- **Safety maintained** - Production code still protected
- **Smart defaults** - Common operations "just work"

### Configuration

The hook is enabled by default. If you need to disable it:

```json
// .claude/hooks/config.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre-tool-use": [
      {
        "script": "00-auto-approve-safe-ops.py",
        "enabled": false  // Set to false to disable
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Examples

**Before v2.3.1:**
```
You: Run the tests
Claude: Can I run `npm test`? [Waiting for approval...]
You: [Away getting coffee]
Claude: [Still waiting...]
```

**After v2.3.1:**
```
You: Run the tests
Claude: ✓ Auto-approved: shell_command
[Tests run immediately]
[Results ready when you return]
```

### Technical Details

The hook uses a whitelist approach for maximum safety:
- Only explicitly safe operations are approved
- Any uncertainty defaults to requiring approval
- All auto-approvals are logged for transparency
- Hook failures fail safely (require approval)

### Coming Next

This is the first step in our workflow optimization initiative. Future enhancements may include:
- Configurable safe operation lists
- Project-specific auto-approval rules
- Time-based approval windows
- Batch operation approvals

### Feedback

This enhancement was inspired by Steve Sewell's Claude Code workflow. If you have suggestions for other workflow improvements, please share them!
