# üöÄ Ready to Go Public - Action Items

## üìã Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Run the Cleanup Script
```bash
cd /Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/boilerplate-python
./scripts/clean-before-public.sh
```

This will:
- Remove `.env.local` and `.mcp.json.local` 
- Clean all sensitive Claude directories
- Remove Python cache files
- Clean OS-specific files
- Run security verification

### 2. Commit the New Files
```bash
git add .gitignore SECURITY.md SECURITY_SWEEP_RESULTS.md scripts/clean-before-public.sh
git commit -m "chore: prepare repository for public release

- Add comprehensive security policy (SECURITY.md)
- Add security sweep results and recommendations
- Update .gitignore with additional patterns
- Add cleanup script for pre-public preparation
- Ensure all sensitive data patterns are excluded"
```

### 3. Push Changes
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 4. Final Verification
After cleanup and commit:
1. Review the PRE_PUBLIC_CHECKLIST.md thoroughly
2. Verify all sensitive files are removed locally
3. Check that no secrets exist in git history
4. Get team sign-off

### 5. Make Repository Public
Once everything is verified:
1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Danger Zone
2. Click "Change visibility" ‚Üí "Make public"
3. Type repository name to confirm

### 6. Post-Public Actions
Immediately after making public:
1. Enable branch protection on `main`
2. Set up Dependabot security alerts
3. Enable secret scanning
4. Add repository topics for discoverability

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Reminders

- **DO NOT** skip the cleanup script - it removes local sensitive files
- **DO NOT** make public until `.env.local` is deleted
- **DO NOT** make public until `.mcp.json.local` is deleted
- **DO NOT** make public without running security verification

## ‚úÖ What's Already Good

- Comprehensive `.gitignore` (now updated)
- No secrets in GitHub repository
- Excellent documentation
- Security verification scripts
- CODEOWNERS file configured
- Example files with placeholders only

## üéØ Success Criteria

The repository is ready to go public when:
- [ ] Cleanup script runs successfully
- [ ] No `.env.local` or `.mcp.json.local` files exist
- [ ] All Claude sensitive directories are empty
- [ ] Security verification passes
- [ ] Team has reviewed and approved
- [ ] PRE_PUBLIC_CHECKLIST.md is complete

---

You're very close! Just run the cleanup script and follow the steps above. The repository structure and documentation are excellent - it just needs the local sensitive files removed before going public.
