# Release v2.3.3 - Hook System Enhancements

## 🎯 Overview
This release adds three powerful enhancements to the hook system based on advanced patterns from the Claude hooks ecosystem:
1. **PreCompact Hook Support** - Preserves context during conversation compaction
2. **Command Suggestion Engine** - Educational corrections for design violations
3. **Structured Command Logging** - Queryable history of all commands

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. PreCompact Hook Support
Solves the "4-hour session amnesia" problem by detecting when Claude is about to compact the conversation and preserving critical context.

**Implementation:**
- New hook: `.claude/hooks/notification/01-precompact-handler.py`
- Automatically saves critical files list before compaction
- Integrates with `/sr` (smart resume) for seamless restoration
- Preserves current task context and active feature PRDs

**Usage:**
```bash
# Automatic - no action needed!
# When compaction occurs, you'll see:
🔄 Context preservation triggered before compaction
📁 Preserving 7 critical files
💡 Run /sr after compaction to restore full context

# After compaction:
/sr
# Automatically detects and restores pre-compact context
```

### 2. Command Suggestion Engine
Transforms design violations from blockers into teaching moments with helpful suggestions.

**Features:**
- Maps common violations to specific corrections
- Tracks patterns to show your most common mistakes
- Provides context-aware explanations
- Categories: typography, spacing, accessibility, color

**Example Output:**
```
❌ Design System Violation: Typography
📍 Line 23: Found 'text-sm'
✅ Use instead: text-size-3
💡 Why: Use text-size-3 (16px) for small text. Our design system uses only 4 font sizes.

📊 Your Most Common Violations:
  • 'text-sm' (12 times) → Use: text-size-3
  • 'p-5' (8 times) → Use: p-4 (16px) or p-6 (24px)
  • 'font-bold' (5 times) → Use: font-semibold
```

**Files:**
- `.claude/utils/suggestion_engine.py` - Core engine
- `.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use/02-design-check-enhanced.py` - Enhanced hook
- `.claude/analytics/design-violations.json` - Tracking data

### 3. Structured Command Logging
Provides queryable history and analytics for all Claude commands.

**Features:**
- Logs all `/` commands with timing and results
- Tracks file changes per command
- Maintains usage statistics
- JSON Lines format for easy streaming

**Query Examples:**
```bash
# View command statistics
/query-logs --stats

# Find recent errors
/query-logs --errors-only

# Query specific commands
/query-logs --command /cc --days 7

# Find slow operations
/query-logs --min-duration 5000

# Analyze sessions
/query-logs --sessions
```

**Log Structure:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "command": "/cc",
  "args": ["Button", "--animate"],
  "duration": 2340,
  "status": "success",
  "files_changed": ["components/ui/Button.tsx"]
}
```

## 📝 Configuration

Added to `.claude/config.json`:
```json
{
  "features": {
    "precompact_support": true,
    "suggestion_engine": true,
    "command_logging": true
  },
  "logging": {
    "retention_days": 30,
    "max_log_size_mb": 100
  }
}
```

### Smart Resume Enhancement
The `/sr` command now checks for pre-compact context:
- Detects `.claude/context/pre-compact-context.json`
- Re-reads all critical files automatically
- Restores task context
- Cleans up after restoration

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **No Breaking Changes** - All enhancements are additive
2. **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box
3. **Educational Focus** - Learn from violations
4. **Performance Insights** - Understand command patterns
5. **Context Preservation** - Never lose work during compaction

## 🚦 Migration Guide

No migration needed! These features activate automatically. To disable any feature:

```json
// In .claude/config.json
{
  "features": {
    "precompact_support": false,  // Disable PreCompact
    "suggestion_engine": false,   // Disable suggestions
    "command_logging": false      // Disable logging
  }
}
```

## 🐛 Known Issues
- PreCompact hooks require Claude Code v1.0.48+
- Command logging starts fresh (no historical data)
- Suggestion engine needs initial learning period

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Export command analytics to CSV
- Suggestion patterns sharing between projects
- PreCompact support for multi-agent workflows
- Integration with performance monitoring
