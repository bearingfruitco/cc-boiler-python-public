```

## Release Process

When creating a new release:

1. **Create release notes here**: `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`
2. **Update RELEASES.md** in project root with summary
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with brief entry
4. **Never create RELEASE_NOTES_*.md in project root**

## Format

Each release note should include:
- Overview of the release
- Key features with details
- New commands/files
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Migration guide (if needed)
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates

## Why This Structure?

- **Clean project root** - No proliferation of RELEASE_NOTES files
- **Easy to find** - All releases in one place
- **Organized** - Clear version history
- **Linked** - RELEASES.md serves as index
