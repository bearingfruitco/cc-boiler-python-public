## Configuration File

Located at `.claude/suggestions-config.json`:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "suggestion_limit": 3,
  "show_help_section": true,
  "time_based_suggestions": true,
  "learning_enabled": true,
  "skip_commands": ["help", "work-status"]
}
```

## Learning System

### How It Learns
1. Tracks command sequences
2. Identifies success patterns
3. Weights suggestions by frequency
4. Personalizes over time

### Privacy
- All data stays local
- No external sharing
- Can be disabled/reset anytime

## Integration

Suggestions appear automatically after commands:
```
/cti "New Feature"
âœ… Created issue #25

ðŸ’¡ Next steps:
  1. `/gt new-feature` - Generate tasks
  2. `/fw start 25` - Start immediately
  3. `/prp new-feature` - Research first
```

## Troubleshooting

### Not Seeing Suggestions?
1. Check if enabled: `/suggestions-config status`
2. Verify command not in skip list
3. Check if hook is active: `ls .claude/hooks/post-tool-use/`

### Too Many Suggestions?
```bash
/suggestions-config limit 2
```

### Wrong Suggestions?
The system learns over time. You can:
1. Reset learning: `/suggestions-config reset`
2. Or just keep using - it will adapt
