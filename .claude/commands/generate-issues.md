# Generate GitHub Issues from PRD (Enhanced)

Converts your PROJECT_PRD.md or feature PRDs into GitHub issues in the CORRECT repository.

## Usage

```bash
/generate-issues PROJECT     # From PROJECT_PRD.md
/gi PROJECT                  # Short alias

/generate-issues [feature]   # From feature PRD
/gi user-dashboard          # Example
```

## Repository Safety Check

Before creating any issues, the command now:

1. **Verifies Repository Configuration**:
   ```
   Checking repository configuration...
   Current repo: YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME ‚úì
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  ERROR if still pointing to boilerplate:
   Cannot create issues in boilerplate repository!
   Run /init-project first to configure YOUR repository.
   ```

2. **Confirms Target Repository**:
   ```
   Will create issues in: YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME
   
   Is this correct? (y/n): y
   ```

3. **Checks GitHub App Permissions**:
   ```
   Checking GitHub permissions...
   ‚úì Write access to issues
   ‚úì Write access to pull requests
   ```

## What It Does

### For PROJECT-level:
1. Reads `docs/project/PROJECT_PRD.md`
2. Verifies target repository
3. Extracts each major feature
4. Creates GitHub issues in YOUR repo
5. Updates `docs/project/ISSUE_MAP.md`

### For feature-level:
1. Reads `docs/project/features/[feature]-PRD.md`
2. Creates sub-issues for complex features
3. Links to parent issue
4. Updates issue map

## Example Flow

```bash
# After /init-project creates PROJECT_PRD.md:
/gi PROJECT

# Output:
Repository Check:
  Target: shawnsmith/tofu-quiz-app ‚úì
  Apps: CodeRabbit ‚úì, Claude Code ‚úì

## Configuration Check

Reads from `.claude/project-config.json`:
```json
{
  "repository": {
    "owner": "shawnsmith",
    "name": "tofu-quiz-app",
    "branch": "main"
  }
}
```

If this file is missing or still shows boilerplate:
```
‚ùå ERROR: Repository not configured!
   
   Please run /init-project first to set up your repository.
   
   Current config shows: bearingfruitco/claude-code-boilerplate
   This would create issues in the WRONG repository!
```

## Integration with Workflow

```bash
/init-project        # Sets up YOUR repo (required first!)
/gi PROJECT          # Creates issues in YOUR repo
/fw start 1          # Works with YOUR repo's issue #1
/prd user-auth       # Creates feature PRD
/gt user-auth        # Generates tasks
/pt user-auth        # Processes tasks
/fw complete 1       # Creates PR in YOUR repo
```

## Batch Operations

New capability for multiple features:
```bash
/gi PROJECT --batch  # Creates all issues at once

# Or selectively:
/gi PROJECT --only "auth,quiz"  # Just these features
```

## Safety Features

1. **Never creates issues in boilerplate repo**
2. **Always shows target repo before creating**
3. **Validates GitHub App permissions**
4. **Creates backup in `docs/project/issues-backup.json`**
5. **Dry run mode**: `/gi PROJECT --dry-run`

This ensures your issues always go to the right place!
