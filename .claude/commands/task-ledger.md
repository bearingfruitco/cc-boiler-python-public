## Actions:

### VIEW (default)
Show current task ledger status:
```bash
/tl view
# or just
/tl
```

Output:
```markdown
# Task Ledger Summary

## Active Tasks (3)

- âœ… **performance-optimization** - 8/8 tasks (100%)

## Statistics
- Total Active Tasks: 35
- Completed Tasks: 16 (45.7%)
- Blocked Tasks: 15
- Time This Week: 12h 30m
```

### UPDATE
Update task progress for a specific feature:
```bash
/tl update user-authentication
```

This will:
1. Read the current task file
2. Count completed tasks (marked with [x])
3. Update progress in ledger
4. Update status if all complete

### LINK
Link a feature to a GitHub issue:
```bash
/tl link data-pipeline 25
```

Updates the ledger entry with:
- Issue number
- Suggested branch name
- Issue title and description

### GENERATE
Generate task ledger from existing task files:
```bash
/tl generate
```

Scans `docs/project/features/*.md` and creates/updates ledger entries.
Useful for:
- Migrating existing projects
- Recovering from ledger corruption
- Initial setup

### CLEAN
Remove completed tasks older than X days:
```bash
/tl clean 30
```

Archives completed tasks to `.task-ledger-archive.md`.

## Integration with Other Commands:

The task ledger integrates with:
- `/gt` - Automatically adds entries when generating tasks
- `/pt` - Updates progress as tasks are completed
- `/fw start` - Links issues when starting features
- `/ws` - Includes ledger summary in work status
- `/sr` - Shows pending tasks on resume

## Ledger File Format:

The `.task-ledger.md` file uses this structure:
```markdown
# Task Ledger for [project]

This file tracks all tasks generated and processed by Claude Code commands.

## Task: [feature-name]
**Generated**: [timestamp]
**Issue**: #[number] - [title]
**Status**: Generated | In Progress | Completed | Blocked
**Branch**: feature/[branch-name]
**Progress**: [completed]/[total] tasks completed ([percentage]%)
**Time Spent**: [optional time tracking]
**Blocked By**: [optional blocker reference]
