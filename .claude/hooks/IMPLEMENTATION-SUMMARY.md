# Claude Code Hooks Implementation Summary

## What We Built

I've created a comprehensive hooks system for your multi-agent collaboration between you and Nikki. Here's what it does:

### ðŸš€ Smart Auto-Approval (NEW in v2.3.1)
- **No more interruptions**: Safe operations proceed automatically
- **Test files auto-approved**: Edit test files without prompts
- **Read operations flow**: All file reading happens instantly
- **Production protected**: Important files still require approval

### ðŸ”„ Automatic GitHub Sync
- **Before any file edit**: Pulls latest changes from GitHub
- **Prevents conflicts**: Warns if Nikki recently edited the same file
- **Tracks activity**: Shows who's working on what in real-time

### ðŸŽ¨ Design System Enforcement
- **Blocks violations before they're written**
- **Auto-fix suggestions**: Corrects font sizes, weights, and spacing
- **Metrics tracking**: Builds compliance statistics over time

### ðŸ’¾ Work State Persistence
- **Auto-saves to GitHub gists** every 60 seconds
- **PR descriptions** updated with current state
- **Perfect handoffs**: Nikki can pick up exactly where you left off

### ðŸ‘¥ Team Awareness
- **Real-time notifications**: "Nikki edited this file 23m ago"
- **Smart suggestions**: "Work on API since Nikki is doing components"
- **Conflict prevention**: Warns before you step on each other's toes

### ðŸ“š Knowledge Sharing
- **Pattern extraction**: Learns from each session
- **Team knowledge base**: Shared solutions and patterns
- **GitHub discussions**: Significant learnings posted automatically

## How to Use It

### Installation (One Time)

```bash
# In your project directory
cd /Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/claude-code-boilerplate-docs/boilerplate
./.claude/scripts/install-hooks.sh

# Follow prompts to set your username (shawn)
```

### For Nikki's Setup

When Nikki clones the repo, she just needs to:

```bash
# Change user to her name
echo '{"current_user": "nikki"}' > .claude/team/config.json

# That's it! Hooks are already configured
```

### Daily Workflow

1. **Start Work**
   ```bash
   /sr  # Hooks show what Nikki did
   ```

2. **Create Components**
   ```bash
   /cc ui Button
   # Design violations blocked automatically
   # Auto-fix offered if possible
   ```

3. **During Work**
   - Every 60 seconds: Work saved to GitHub gist
   - Every file edit: Team registry updated
   - Design violations: Blocked in real-time

4. **End of Session**
   - Session summary generated
   - Knowledge extracted and shared
   - Handoff document created

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

#### When You Edit a File:
1. **Pre-checks run**:
   - Git pulls latest changes
   - Checks if Nikki edited recently
   - Validates design system compliance

2. **If all good**: Edit proceeds
3. **If issues**: You get warnings or auto-fix options

#### Every 60 Seconds:
- Work state saved to GitHub gist
- Team registry updated
- Metrics collected

#### When Session Ends:
- Full state saved
- Learnings extracted
- Handoff prepared

## Key Features for Your Workflow

### 1. **Worktree Support**
The system tracks which worktree each person is in, preventing conflicts when you're both working on different features.

### 2. **Automatic Documentation**
Every component created gets documented automatically with its design compliance status.

### 3. **GitHub Integration**
- Gists for work state (private by default)
- PR descriptions auto-updated
- Issues commented with progress

### 4. **Voice Notifications**
Optional voice alerts for:
- Design violations
- Team conflicts
- Session completion

## Configuration

The system is configured in `.claude/hooks/config.json`:

```json
{
  "team": {
    "members": ["shawn", "nikki"],
    "sync_interval": 300,  // Sync every 5 minutes
    "auto_pull": true
  },
  "design_system": {
    "enforce": true,
    "auto_fix": true
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Conflicts**: GitHub sync prevents overwrites
2. **Consistent Design**: Violations impossible to commit
3. **Seamless Handoffs**: State transfers perfectly
4. **Shared Learning**: Patterns discovered by one help both
5. **Async Work**: Different schedules, no friction

## Monitoring

Check the system's work:

```bash
# View design compliance metrics
cat .claude/team/metrics/design-compliance.json

# See active work
cat .claude/team/registry.json

# Check knowledge base
cat .claude/team/knowledge-base.json

# Latest handoff
cat .claude/team/handoffs/latest.md
```

## Troubleshooting

If hooks aren't running:
1. Restart Claude Code
2. Check Python 3 is installed
3. Run: `python3 .claude/scripts/test-hooks.py`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the installation**: Run the install script
2. **Try creating a component** with a design violation
3. **Check the metrics** after a few edits
4. **Share with Nikki** for her setup

The system is designed to be invisible during normal work but protective when needed. You'll only notice it when it's saving you from problems!
