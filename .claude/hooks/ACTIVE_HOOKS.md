## New TDD Features

### Test-Driven Development Hooks
- **19-test-generation-enforcer.py**: Enforces test-first development by blocking code without tests

### Branch Management Configuration
- Maximum active branches enforcement
- Required main sync before new branches
- File locking to prevent conflicts
- Feature state protection
- Smart branch switching with context preservation

### New Commands
- `/branch-status` (`/bs`) - Comprehensive branch overview
- `/feature-status` (`/fs`) - Check feature completion state
- `/sync-main` - Safely update from main branch
- `/branch-switch` (`/bsw`) - Context-aware branch switching
- `/think-level` (`/tl-think`) - Set thinking depth for complex problems

## New Next Command Suggestions Feature

### Intelligent Workflow Guidance
- **15-next-command-suggester.py**: Provides contextual suggestions after every command
- Learns from your command patterns over time
- Adapts suggestions based on:
  - Current workflow stage
  - Time of day
  - Task complexity
  - Success patterns

### Configuration
- Managed via `.claude/suggestions-config.json`
- Can disable for specific commands
- Adjustable suggestion limit
- Learning system can be toggled

### Benefits
- Never get stuck wondering what to do next
- Discover optimal workflows
- Reduce cognitive load
- Personalized to your development style

## New Features from Claude Code Integration

### Permission Profiles (ENHANCED)
- **Dynamic permission management** based on context
- Profiles: exploration, development, testing, ci_pipeline, multi_agent
- Auto-switches based on commands (e.g., `/test` â†’ testing profile)
- Configured in `.claude/permission-profiles.json`

### Screenshot Capture
- **Automatic browser screenshot on test failures**
- Integrates with playwright, puppeteer, or native tools
- Links screenshots to Task Ledger entries
- Stores in `.claude/screenshots/`

### Auto-staging
- **Git auto-staging after successful operations**
- Stages files after tests pass
- Excludes sensitive files (.env, secrets)
- Maintains staging log for tracking

### Thinking Levels
- **Graduated reasoning depth** for complex problems
- Levels: standard, deep, ultra
- Token usage tracking
- Auto-escalation for security/critical issues

### Enhanced Context Compression
- **Focus areas** to preserve critical information
- Exclude specific topics from compression
- Target compression percentages
- Integration with workflow triggers
