# Next Command Suggestion System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Suggestion Engine
- **Hook**: `15-next-command-suggester.py` (PostToolUse)
- Provides contextual suggestions after every command
- Integrates with existing workflow state
- Respects configuration settings

### 2. Command Flow Mappings
Intelligent suggestions for:
- `capture-to-issue` → Generate tasks or start work
- `generate-tasks` → Orchestrate or process sequentially  
- `feature-workflow` → Handle different stages
- `process-tasks` → Continue, test, or handle blocks
- `test-runner` → Complete feature or debug failures
- `py-prd` → Create issues or design architecture
- And many more...

### 3. Time-Based Intelligence
- Morning: Suggests resume (`/sr`)
- Evening: Suggests checkpoint (`/checkpoint`)
- Long sessions: Reminds to save/test

### 4. Learning System
- `sequence_learner.py` utility
- Tracks command patterns
- Identifies successful workflows
- Personalizes suggestions over time

### 5. Configuration System
- `suggestions-config.json` for preferences
- Toggle on/off
- Adjust suggestion count
- Skip specific commands
- Enable/disable learning

### 6. New Command
- `/suggestions-config` - Manage the system
- View patterns
- Adjust settings
- Reset learning data

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Non-Breaking Design
1. **Complements existing hooks** - Works alongside `03-smart-suggest.py`
2. **Uses existing state** - Reads workflow_state.json, branch-registry.json
3. **Standard hook format** - Follows official documentation
4. **Configurable** - Can be disabled without affecting other features
5. **Progressive enhancement** - Adds value without changing core behavior

### Works With
- Branch management system
- Feature state protection
- TDD enforcement
- Multi-agent orchestration
- All 70+ existing commands

## 📊 How It Works

### Command Execution Flow
```
User runs command
    ↓
Command executes
    ↓
PostToolUse hooks fire
    ↓
15-next-command-suggester:
  - Analyzes command & result
  - Checks context
  - Generates suggestions
  - Displays to user
    ↓
User sees suggestions
```

### Suggestion Logic
1. Check command-specific flows
2. Analyze output for context
3. Consider time factors
4. Apply learning data
5. Format top 3 suggestions

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before
```bash
/cti "Fix import"
✅ Created issue #17

# User wonders what to do next...
```

### After
```bash
/cti "Fix import"
✅ Created issue #17

💡 Next steps:
  1. `/gt import-fix` - Generate detailed task breakdown
  2. `/fw start 17` - Start working immediately
  3. `/prp import-optimization` - If research needed

🤔 Need help?
  • `/help` - See all commands
  • `/ws` - Check work status
  • `/think-through` - Get AI guidance
```

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Guided Workflow** - Always know next step
2. **Discoverability** - Learn commands in context
3. **Efficiency** - Follow optimal paths
4. **Personalization** - Adapts to your style
5. **Reduced Cognitive Load** - Focus on code, not process

## 📈 Future Enhancements

The system is designed to grow:
- Add more command flows
- Deeper learning algorithms
- Team pattern sharing
- Success rate tracking
- A/B testing suggestions

## 🔍 Monitoring

Track effectiveness with:
- Command sequence logs
- Pattern analysis
- User choice tracking
- Success metrics

The Next Command Suggestion System is now active and will help guide every step of the development workflow!
