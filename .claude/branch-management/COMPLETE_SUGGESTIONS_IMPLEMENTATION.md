## âœ… Full Command Decision Guide Coverage

The Next Command Suggestion System now covers ALL scenarios from the Command Decision Guide:

### 1. **Starting New Projects**
- `/init-project` â†’ suggests PRD â†’ Issues â†’ Development
- `/py-prd` â†’ suggests Generate Issues â†’ Architecture â†’ CTI

### 2. **Capturing Work & Ideas**
- `/cti` â†’ suggests Generate Tasks or Start Work (with complexity detection)
- `/prp` â†’ full research workflow (create â†’ execute â†’ status â†’ complete)

### 3. **Breaking Down Work**
- `/gi` â†’ suggests starting first issue or viewing task board
- `/gt` â†’ detects orchestration opportunities and suggests accordingly

### 4. **Day-to-Day Development**
- `/fw start` â†’ checks for tasks and suggests appropriate next step
- `/pt` â†’ handles completion, blocks, and continuation
- `/mt` â†’ suggests testing and committing

### 5. **Bug Management**
- `/bt add` â†’ suggests test generation, assignment, or fix workflow
- `/bt resolve` â†’ suggests verification and next work

### 6. **Complex Features & Research**
- `/orch` â†’ suggests monitoring and agent management
- `/think-through` â†’ suggests CTI, PRP, or PRD based on outcome

### 7. **Testing & Quality**
- Test results guide to completion or debugging
- Failed tests suggest bug tracking

## ðŸŽ¯ New Decision Context Intelligence

The system now detects when users might be unsure and provides decision guidance:

### Decision Contexts Detected:
1. **Starting New** - Shows project/feature/research options
2. **Have AI Suggestion** - Shows capture/analyze/research options
3. **Found Bug** - Shows track/fix/test options
4. **Complex Problem** - Shows research/analysis options

### Example Output:
```
ðŸŽ¯ Decision Guide:
Starting something new? Choose based on:
  1. `/init-project` - Brand new project/repository
  2. `/py-prd feature` - New feature with requirements
  3. `/prp topic` - Complex problem needing research
```
