# TDD Automation Integration Summary

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Auto Test Generation Hook** (`13-auto-test-generation.py`)
- Monitors key workflow trigger points
- Automatically generates tests when:
  - `/fw start <issue>` - Starting work on an issue
  - `/pt <feature>` - Processing tasks
  - `/cti --tests` - Creating issues with test flag
  - Writing PRD/PRP files
  - Updating task files

### 2. **Enhanced Feature Workflow** (`feature-workflow.md`)
- Now includes automatic test generation when starting features
- Adds new `test-status` action to check TDD progress
- Opens test file in editor after generation
- Shows test status (red/green) throughout workflow

### 3. **Smart Task Processing** (`process-tasks.md`) 
- Checks for tests before allowing implementation
- Shows which test relates to current task
- Auto-runs tests after implementation
- Prevents marking tasks complete until tests pass

### 4. **TDD Configuration** (`.claude/settings.json`)
```json
{
  "tdd": {
    "auto_generate_tests": true,
    "enforce_tests_first": true,
    "test_on_save": true,
    "block_without_tests": true,
    "minimum_coverage": 80,
    "open_tests_in_editor": true,
    "require_tests_before_tasks": true,
    "auto_run_tests": true,
    "show_test_hints": true
  }
}
```

### 5. **New Workflow Chains**
- `/chain tdd` or `/tdd` - Complete TDD feature workflow
- `/chain tf` - Test-first approach
- `/chain vi` - Validate implementation

## 📋 How It Works

### Starting a Feature (Before)
```bash
/fw start 123                    # Create branch
# Manually: /generate-tests      # Remember to create tests
# Start implementing...          # Hope you wrote tests first
```

### Starting a Feature (Now)
```bash
/fw start 123                    # Create branch
# ✅ Tests auto-generated from issue
# 🔴 5 tests failing (expected)
# 📝 Test file opens in editor
# Ready to implement!
```

### Processing Tasks (Before)
```bash
/pt user-auth                    # Start task
# Working on task 1.1...         # No test verification
# Implement code...              # Tests? What tests?
```

### Processing Tasks (Now)
```bash
/pt user-auth                    # Start task
# 🧪 Checking tests... Found!
# Working on task 1.1: Create User model
# Test: test_user_model_creation (🔴 failing)
# To make test pass: implement User class...
# [After implementation]
# ✅ Test passing! Task complete.
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

All TDD behavior can be customized in `.claude/settings.json`:

- `auto_generate_tests` - Enable/disable automatic test generation
- `enforce_tests_first` - Block code creation without tests
- `minimum_coverage` - Required test coverage percentage
- `require_tests_before_tasks` - Check tests before task processing

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Zero Friction TDD** - Tests are there when you need them
2. **Specification First** - Tests document expected behavior
3. **Quality Gates** - Can't proceed without passing tests
4. **Regression Prevention** - All features have test coverage
5. **Documentation** - Tests serve as living documentation

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Trust the Automation** - Let the system generate tests first
2. **Review Generated Tests** - AI creates good starting points
3. **Add Edge Cases** - Enhance generated tests as needed
4. **Use Test Status** - `/fw test-status 123` to check progress
5. **Configure to Taste** - Adjust settings for your workflow

## 🚦 Getting Started

```bash
# Option 1: Start new feature (auto-generates tests)
/fw start 123

# Option 2: Use TDD chain for complete workflow  
/chain tdd

# Option 3: Capture requirements and generate tests
/cti "New Feature" --tests

# Check your TDD settings
cat .claude/settings.json | grep -A10 "tdd"
```

The system now ensures that tests exist before implementation begins, making TDD the default rather than an afterthought!
