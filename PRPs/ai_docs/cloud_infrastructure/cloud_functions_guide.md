Overview of Google Cloud Run
Google Cloud Run is a fully managed, serverless container platform that runs any OCI‑compliant container and automatically scales from zero up to as many instances as needed. It load balances requests across container instances and abstracts away infrastructure management. Cloud Run services expose a HTTPS endpoint and can scale to handle incoming requests, while Cloud Run Jobs execute batch or scheduled tasks without exposing a web endpoint. Each deployment creates a revision, and traffic can be split across revisions for canary deployments

.

Key updates and features (2024 – 2025)
Concurrency and scaling – By default, each Cloud Run instance handles up to 80 concurrent requests, but the concurrency can be increased to 1 000 or reduced to 1 when resource limitations or non‑thread‑safe code require serial processing
datadoghq.com
. Services automatically scale up to 100 instances (configurable) and scale down to zero unless a minimum instance count is specified
datadoghq.com
.

CPU allocation modes – Cloud Run now offers two CPU modes. In CPU allocated on demand (default), CPU is only available during request processing. In CPU always allocated, CPU remains active between requests, enabling background tasks; this mode may cost more but can reduce latency for steady workloads
engineering.szns.solutions
. The Recommender tool analyses traffic and recommends switching modes if it reduces cost
engineering.szns.solutions
.

Sidecar/multi‑container support – In 2024 Google introduced the ability to run multiple containers in a single Cloud Run service. A sidecar container can run alongside the main application container to handle logging, proxying, or instrumentation. According to Google, sidecars support use cases such as running an OpenTelemetry collector, proxies like Nginx/Envoy, authentication filters and outbound connection proxies
grafana.com
.

Eventarc integration – Eventarc delivers events from Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, Cloud Audit Logs and third‑party sources to Cloud Run. Codelabs show how to create Pub/Sub triggers with gcloud to route messages to a service
codelabs.developers.google.com
 and how to create triggers with existing topics
codelabs.developers.google.com
 or Cloud Storage events
codelabs.developers.google.com
.

Observability improvements – Cloud Run now supports third‑party observability tools via sidecars. For example, a Grafana blog notes that the OpenTelemetry collector can run as a sidecar to gather metrics/traces and send them to Application Observability
grafana.com
.

Creating and Deploying Cloud Run Services
Building a container
Write a Dockerfile describing your application. The container must listen on PORT (typically 8080) and respond to HTTP requests.

Build and push the image to Artifact Registry or Container Registry. For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/my-service:v1 .
docker push gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/my-service:v1
(Optional) Automate builds using Cloud Build triggers connected to GitHub or GitLab. Cloud Build can build container images from source and push them to Artifact Registry.

Deploying with the gcloud CLI
To deploy a service from an image, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcloud run deploy my-service \
  --image=gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/my-service:v1 \
  --region=REGION \
  --platform=managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --concurrency=80 \
  --cpu=1 --memory=512Mi \
  --min-instances=0 --max-instances=10
The --concurrency, --cpu, --memory, min-instances and max-instances flags control scaling and resource allocation. For always‑allocated CPU, pass --cpu-throttling=false. Load testing your application helps determine appropriate values; one blog recommends targeting 50–70 % CPU and memory utilization
engineering.szns.solutions
.

Deploying from source
For rapid prototyping, Cloud Run can build and deploy directly from source code:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcloud run deploy my-service \
  --source=. \
  --region=REGION \
  --platform=managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated
Google Cloud builds the container using Cloud Build. This is convenient but limits control over the build process.

Continuous deployment from GitHub
You can integrate Cloud Run deployment into a GitHub Actions workflow using the google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun action. The action accepts a service name, image or source path, environment variables, secrets and other parameters. The README notes that it deploys an image or source and outputs the service URL. Example workflow:

yaml
Copy
Edit
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
        with:
          workload_identity_provider: 'projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/pool/providers/provider'
          service_account: 'deployer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com'
      - id: deploy
        uses: google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun@v2
        with:
          service: 'my-service'
          image: 'gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/my-service:v1'
          concurrency: '80'
          region: 'us-central1'
          env_vars: |
            ENV1=value1
            ENV2=value2
Pros of GitHub Actions: Automated CI/CD and traceability; integrates with code reviews. Cons: Additional setup (service accounts, secrets) and potential complexity for small projects. For simple deployments or one‑off experiments, using gcloud run deploy may be faster.

Recommended Configuration Settings
Setting	Guidance & Rationale
Concurrency	Default 80 concurrent requests per instance. Increase toward 1 000 for I/O‑bound services to reduce instance count; decrease to 1 for CPU‑bound or thread‑unsafe code
datadoghq.com
.
CPU & memory	Start with 1 CPU and 512 MiB; adjust via load testing. Aim for 50–70 % utilization to balance cost and performance
engineering.szns.solutions
.
Min/Max instances	Set max instances to limit scaling and protect databases
datadoghq.com
. Use min instances >0 to reduce cold‑start latency
datadoghq.com
.
CPU allocation mode	Use CPU on demand (default) for request‑driven workloads. Use CPU always allocated for applications needing background tasks or steady traffic; although unit pricing is lower, total cost depends on utilization
engineering.szns.solutions
.
Sidecar containers	To add observability or proxies, deploy sidecar containers in the same service. Google’s 2024 update allows multi‑container deployments
grafana.com
.
Revisions & traffic splitting	Each deploy creates a new revision. Use traffic splitting to gradually roll out new versions and perform canary deployments
datadoghq.com

Logging, Monitoring and Error Handling
Structured logging
Cloud Run automatically streams anything printed to stdout or stderr to Cloud Logging. Writing logs as structured JSON improves query and error detection. A blog demonstrates using Go’s slog handler to rename keys (message, severity, logging.googleapis.com/sourceLocation) and output JSON; Cloud Logging then indexes these fields
mko.re
. The handler can also extract the X‑Cloud‑Trace‑Context header and add a logging.googleapis.com/trace field so log entries correlate with request logs
mko.re
. In Node.js, you can implement a similar approach:

js
Copy
Edit
const logger = new Bunyan({ name: 'my-app', serializers: bunyan.stdSerializers });
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const trace = req.header('X-Cloud-Trace-Context')?.split('/')[0];
  logger.fields = { 'logging.googleapis.com/trace': `projects/${PROJECT_ID}/traces/${trace}` };
  next();
});
logger.info({ userId }, 'User logged in');
Viewing logs
You can query logs using the Logs Explorer in the Cloud console or with the CLI. Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcloud beta logging read \
  'resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=my-service' \
  --limit=50 --format=json
Filter by severity=ERROR to find exceptions. Integrate with Error Reporting to aggregate exceptions; Cloud Run automatically connects logs with stack traces to Error Reporting.

Error handling and HTTP responses
Implement robust error handling within your service:

Use try/except (Python) or try/catch (JavaScript) blocks around external calls or business logic. Log exceptions with structured JSON and return HTTP 500 status codes.

Validate incoming requests; for example, a webhook endpoint should reject non‑POST methods with a 405 Method Not Allowed response and parse JSON safely
hookdeck.com
.

Return appropriate HTTP status codes: 2xx for success, 4xx for client errors (e.g., bad payload), 5xx for server errors.

Do not swallow exceptions; instead, log and propagate them so Cloud Run reports them.

Monitoring and observability
Metrics & autoscaling: Monitor CPU and memory metrics via Cloud Monitoring or third‑party tools. Concurrency settings and autoscaling thresholds directly affect latency and cost. The Datadog article explains how high concurrency reduces instance count while low concurrency can increase latency and cost
datadoghq.com
.

Third‑party observability: Deploy an OpenTelemetry collector as a sidecar and use Application Observability (Grafana) to collect metrics/traces
grafana.com
.

Alerts: Set up alerts on CPU utilization (e.g., above 90 %)
datadoghq.com
 and high instance counts.

Webhooks, Ingestion and Event Handling
Webhooks
To expose a webhook, define an HTTP endpoint in your application and validate the request. A sample Express handler:

js
Copy
Edit
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  try {
    const payload = req.body;
    console.log(JSON.stringify({ severity: 'INFO', message: 'Webhook received', payload }));
    // process payload…
    res.status(200).send('Processed');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(JSON.stringify({ severity: 'ERROR', message: 'Processing failed', error: err.message }));
    res.status(500).send('Error');
  }
});
A webhook handler should return HTTP 200 for success; otherwise Cloud Run or the webhook provider may retry. Use try/catch and log errors.

Ingestion and event routing with Eventarc
Eventarc routes events from Google Cloud services to Cloud Run. To create a Pub/Sub trigger that sends messages to your service:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcloud services enable eventarc.googleapis.com
SERVICE_ACCOUNT=eventarc-trigger-sa
gcloud iam service-accounts create $SERVICE_ACCOUNT
TRIGGER_NAME=trigger-pubsub
gcloud eventarc triggers create $TRIGGER_NAME \
  --destination-run-service=my-service \
  --destination-run-region=REGION \
  --event-filters="type=google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished" \
  --location=REGION \
  --service-account=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
This command creates a Pub/Sub topic behind the scenes; publishing messages to the topic will invoke your service
codelabs.developers.google.com
. You can also use an existing topic by specifying --transport-topic
codelabs.developers.google.com
.

To trigger on Cloud Storage object finalization events, create a bucket and Eventarc trigger:

bash
Copy
Edit
gsutil mb -l REGION gs://BUCKET_NAME
# grant roles/eventarc.eventReceiver and roles/pubsub.publisher as in codelab
TRIGGER_NAME=trigger-storage
gcloud eventarc triggers create $TRIGGER_NAME \
  --destination-run-service=my-service \
  --destination-run-region=REGION \
  --event-filters="type=google.cloud.storage.object.v1.finalized" \
  --event-filters="bucket=BUCKET_NAME" \
  --location=REGION \
  --service-account=eventarc-trigger-sa@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Eventarc abstracts transport, retries and error handling
codelabs.developers.google.com
. For each trigger, ensure the service account has eventarc.eventReceiver and appropriate Pub/Sub roles
codelabs.developers.google.com
.

Jobs and batch processing
Use Cloud Run Jobs for batch tasks that do not expose an HTTP endpoint. Jobs spin up one or more tasks, each running a container; you can configure retries and parallelism
datadoghq.com
. Jobs are ideal for database exports, data ingestion or scheduled ETL processes.

Multi‑Container Services and Sidecars
Starting in 2024, Cloud Run supports multi‑container deployments. A single service can include a main container and additional sidecar containers. The Grafana article notes that sidecars enable running an OpenTelemetry collector for telemetry, proxies for routing, or authentication filters
grafana.com
. Our service template (provided in JSON) shows a main application container and a sidecar collecting telemetry. The sidecar can mount configuration files via volumes and share environment variables.

Should you deploy from GitHub or use gcloud?
Approach	Advantages	Considerations
gcloud CLI	Simple for ad‑hoc deployments; full control over flags like concurrency and CPU; no external dependencies.	Requires manual execution; not automatically triggered by code changes.
GitHub Actions	Provides automated CI/CD; integrates with code reviews; uses the deploy-cloudrun action which supports images or source deployments and outputs the service URL.	Requires setting up service accounts and secrets; YAML configuration adds complexity; remote builds may delay feedback.
Cloud Build triggers	Automatically build and deploy on git push; integrated into Google Cloud console; supports YAML triggers.	Less visible inside GitHub; some configuration lives in Cloud Build rather than repository.

For small teams and prototypes, using gcloud run deploy may be easiest. For production applications or frequent updates, a GitHub Actions workflow ensures repeatable deployments and traceability.

Deliverables for your agent
Two machine‑readable files accompany this report:

cloud_run_instructions.json – A JSON document describing tasks, commands and code snippets to build, deploy and manage Cloud Run services. It includes steps for building container images, gcloud deployment, GitHub Actions configuration, structured logging, checking logs, creating Eventarc triggers, and handling webhooks. Comments point to relevant citations (e.g., default concurrency and scaling
datadoghq.com
, Eventarc usage
codelabs.developers.google.com
, etc.).

cloud_run_service_template.json – A template representing a Cloud Run service specification (Knative Service resource) encoded as JSON. It demonstrates recommended settings (concurrency, CPU/memory limits, min/max instances) and includes an example sidecar container for an OpenTelemetry collector. Agents can customize this template before deploying via gcloud run services replace. It uses annotations for autoscaling and CPU throttling and defines volumes for configuration.

Next Steps
Customize the JSON files with your project ID, service name, region and resource requirements.

Implement your application with proper error handling and structured logging.

Use the gcloud CLI or GitHub Actions to deploy.

Create Eventarc triggers to route Pub/Sub or Cloud Storage events to your service.

Monitor logs and metrics, adjust concurrency and resources based on utilization, and take advantage of sidecar containers for observability.

By following these guidelines and leveraging the accompanying JSON files, your agent will understand how to build, deploy, monitor and troubleshoot Cloud Run services effectively.


This will include:

# Google Cloud Run: Deployment, Integration, and Best Practices

## Overview of Google Cloud Run

Google Cloud Run is a fully managed, serverless platform for running containerized applications. It automatically handles provisioning, scaling, and infrastructure management, so you can focus on your code. Key characteristics of Cloud Run include:

* **Containerized Workloads:** You package your Python agent in a container image. Cloud Run can then run it on demand in response to HTTP requests or events. This means you can use any web framework (Flask, FastAPI, etc.) or even just a simple HTTP server in Python.
* **Scalability:** Cloud Run scales **from zero to N** instances based on traffic. If no requests come in, it can scale down to zero (no cost when idle). Under load, it can spin up multiple container instances (by default up to 1000 concurrent instances, adjustable) to handle traffic.
* **Concurrency:** By default, each Cloud Run container instance can handle up to 80 concurrent requests. This can be adjusted (even down to 1 if you prefer each instance to handle one request at a time for simplicity or thread-safety). Higher concurrency can improve efficiency but requires your code to be thread-safe.
* **Stateless and Ephemeral:** Cloud Run instances are stateless. Any instance may be terminated when idle, and local state (files, memory) does not persist across requests or across different instances. Use external storage (Cloud Storage, databases, etc.) for stateful needs. Also plan for **cold starts** – when a new instance starts, there may be a short startup latency. You can mitigate this by specifying a minimum number of warm instances if needed (at the cost of always-on billing).
* **Triggers:** Cloud Run services are invoked via HTTP requests by default (each service gets a HTTPS URL). You can integrate with other trigger types using EventArc and Pub/Sub. For example, Cloud Run can be triggered by Pub/Sub messages, Cloud Scheduler (for cron jobs), or Cloud Events (like Cloud Storage or BigQuery events) via EventArc. We’ll discuss trigger methods in detail later.

Overall, Cloud Run is ideal for building an **API or webhook handler service** (like your AI agent) that needs to interact with databases and external APIs, scaling automatically with load and requiring minimal ops maintenance.

## Deploying Cloud Run Services (Source vs. GitHub vs. Container Image)

There are multiple ways to deploy your Python agent to Cloud Run. The main approaches are:

* **Build and Deploy from Source:** You can have Cloud Run build your code into a container image using buildpacks. For example, using the gcloud CLI or Cloud Console, you can point to your source code (in a Git repo or local directory) and let Google Cloud build the container automatically. This is convenient for quick deploys (Cloud Run will generate a Dockerfile or use buildpacks for you).
* **Deploy a Pre-Built Container Image:** Alternatively, you can build the Docker image yourself (using a `Dockerfile`) and push it to a registry (Google Artifact Registry or Container Registry). Then provide that image URL to Cloud Run. This gives more control over the environment (you define the Python runtime, installed packages, etc. in the Dockerfile). It’s slightly more work upfront but often preferred for complex apps.
* **Continuous Deployment from GitHub:** Yes – you can (and likely should) integrate Cloud Run deployment with GitHub for CI/CD. Cloud Run can be connected to your GitHub repo so that on each push, an automated build and deploy occurs (using Cloud Build or GitHub Actions). This ensures your Cloud Run service is always up-to-date with your code. Many teams use **GitHub Actions** workflows to build the Docker image and deploy to Cloud Run on each commit. This is generally a best practice once your project grows beyond quick experiments.

**Should you deploy from GitHub?** For a production system with a team, using GitHub-based CI/CD is highly recommended. It provides version control, code review, and an automated trail of deployments. You mentioned possibly using GitHub Actions – that’s a great choice. Google provides an official GitHub Action called **`google-github-actions/deploy-cloudrun`** that can deploy a service to Cloud Run (from a container image or from source). For secure authentication, you’d typically set up Workload Identity Federation so that the GitHub Action can act as a Google service account without needing JSON key credentials. This requires a one-time setup of a workload identity pool and assigning roles to a service account, but it avoids storing sensitive keys in GitHub. The service account used by CI/CD will need roles like **Cloud Run Admin, Artifact Registry Writer, and Service Account User** in your project (these allow it to deploy new revisions).

In contrast, manual deploys (e.g. using the `gcloud run deploy` command from your machine for each update) can work for prototypes or very small projects, but they don’t scale well for collaboration or frequent updates. Manual deploys risk configuration drift and rely on developers to run the commands each time. Therefore, **deploying via an automated pipeline from GitHub is usually the better approach** for consistency and reliability.

**Deployment process overview:** If you go with GitHub Actions, your flow might be: push code -> GitHub Action builds Docker image (using Docker or Cloud Build) -> pushes image to Artifact Registry -> deploys to Cloud Run. The Cloud Run service gets updated to the new image. You can set this up to deploy to a staging service first, run tests, then deploy to production, etc., depending on your needs (Cloud Run supports traffic splitting between revisions for canary releases as well).

When deploying, you’ll choose a **region** (e.g. `us-central1` or wherever closest to your data/users) and a **service name**. Cloud Run will give your service a default domain like `https://<service>-<project>-<region>.run.app`. You can also map a custom domain if needed later.

**Allowing Public Access:** Since your use case involves webhooks and external systems (LeadProsper, API partners, etc.) calling your service, you will likely want to allow **unauthenticated invocations** (public URL). By default, Cloud Run services require authentication via IAM (meaning only callers with a valid Google identity or service account token can invoke). You can disable that requirement to make the endpoint public. For example, when creating the service via console or gcloud, you’d choose “Allow unauthenticated invocations”. This effectively grants the special `allUsers` principal the Cloud Run Invoker role on your service, making it reachable by anyone who knows the URL. (If you *don’t* want it fully public, you can instead require authentication and only give specific service accounts or users the Invoker role – but for generic webhooks from external systems, that’s usually not feasible, so public is easier).

**Containerizing the Python Agent:** Ensure your agent code is structured to run as a web service. For example, if using Flask: define some endpoints (for different webhook routes or functions), and in Dockerfile start the Flask app with a production server (Gunicorn) listening on port \$PORT (Cloud Run sets the container’s port via `$PORT` env var). If not using a framework, you could use Python’s built-in HTTP server or FastAPI, etc. The container just needs to listen for HTTP and handle requests. Cloud Run will pass incoming HTTP requests to your container.

A simple Python Dockerfile might look like:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim  
WORKDIR /app  
COPY . /app  
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  # install your dependencies  
ENV PORT=8080  
CMD ["gunicorn", "-b", "0.0.0.0:${PORT}", "myagentapp:app"]  # example for Flask app
```

You can adjust based on your app structure. The key is to listen on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`. Cloud Run will route traffic to that port.

## Service Configuration and Settings

When deploying to Cloud Run, you have many configurable settings. Here are the important ones and recommended values for your scenario:

* **Memory and CPU:** By default, a Cloud Run container has 256 MiB of memory and 1 vCPU. You can increase this up to 8 GiB and 4 vCPUs if needed. For a Python agent handling potentially many requests and doing database work, you might want to start with say **512 MiB memory and 1 CPU**, and adjust based on performance. If you do heavy data processing in-memory or large responses, increase memory accordingly.
* **Concurrency:** As mentioned, you can limit concurrency per instance. If your code and libraries are thread-safe and you want to save cost, you can allow >1 concurrency (default 80). This means a single container instance can handle multiple requests in parallel (threads or async). However, if your agent will perform a lot of CPU-bound work for each request (or you want simpler sequential logic), you might set concurrency to 1. This guarantees one request at a time per instance, effectively isolating each request but possibly requiring more instances under load. Evaluate this based on how your agent code behaves.
* **Timeout:** Cloud Run allows each request to run for up to 60 minutes (3600 seconds) now. The default is often 5 minutes if not changed. You should set an appropriate timeout for your requests. For webhooks or API calls, usually a short timeout (a few seconds up to maybe 30s) is ideal so clients aren’t waiting forever. For longer background processing, you could extend it. Make sure external callers (like LeadProsper or partners) have matching timeouts – no point in Cloud Run allowing 5 minutes if the caller will give up after 30 seconds. In general, keep it as low as practical to detect hung requests.
* **Auto-scaling settings:** Cloud Run will scale instances automatically. You can optionally set **minimum instances** > 0 to keep some warm instances always ready (reducing cold start latency). You can also set **maximum instances** to control cost or rate limiting. For example, if you wanted to ensure at most 10 concurrent instances (maybe to not overwhelm a database), you can set max instances to 10. In your case, if many webhooks may come in concurrently, ensure the database can handle it or put a reasonable cap.
* **Ingress settings:** By default, ingress is “all” (allows traffic from anywhere, including internet). You can restrict to internal (only allow calls from within your VPC or Google Cloud), but since external services will call this, **keep ingress as “all”**.
* **VPC Connectivity:** If you need to access internal resources or use a fixed egress IP, you can attach a Serverless VPC Connector. For example, if your Supabase database required a specific outbound IP (for whitelisting) or if you needed to reach a private network, a VPC connector is useful. It allows your Cloud Run service to send outbound traffic through your VPC (and through Cloud NAT for a static IP). If Supabase is just open on the internet (with host/port and password), you might not need this. But keep in mind, Cloud Run’s outbound IPs are not fixed unless you use a VPC connector with Cloud NAT. Check Supabase’s settings; if they offer IP whitelisting and you want to secure the connection, you could set up a VPC connector. Otherwise, ensure your Supabase is configured to allow external connections (it usually is, via SSL).
* **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to configure your service. Cloud Run makes it easy to set env vars either via the UI, gcloud flags, or YAML. For example, store your database connection strings, API keys (Supabase anon or service keys, etc.), and other config in env vars. You can even mount certain secrets via Secret Manager (which we’ll touch on). But at minimum, avoid hardcoding credentials in code – inject them via env vars so they can be changed per environment.

Below is a **JSON template** showing how a Cloud Run service configuration might look. This includes some of the settings above (it’s a translation of Cloud Run’s YAML to JSON format, which you could feed to the Cloud Run Admin API or use for reference):

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "serving.knative.dev/v1",
  "kind": "Service",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "YOUR_SERVICE_NAME",
    "annotations": {
      "run.googleapis.com/ingress": "all",
      "run.googleapis.com/cpu-throttling": "false",
      "autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale": "50"
    }
  },
  "spec": {
    "template": {
      "spec": {
        "containerConcurrency": 80,
        "timeoutSeconds": 30,
        "serviceAccountName": "YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT",
        "containers": [{
          "image": "REGION-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR_PROJECT/YOUR_REPO/IMAGE:TAG",
          "env": [
            { "name": "SUPABASE_URL", "value": "<your-supabase-url>" },
            { "name": "SUPABASE_KEY", "value": "<your-supabase-key>" },
            { "name": "BIGQUERY_DATASET", "value": "<default-dataset-name>" }
          ],
          "resources": {
            "limits": { "cpu": "1", "memory": "512Mi" }
          }
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Notes on the above config:**

* `cpu-throttling: false` ensures the container CPU is not throttled when idle (i.e., “CPU always allocated”). By default, Cloud Run pauses CPU when there are no requests to save money. If your agent needs to do background work (e.g., a background thread, or work after sending an HTTP response), disabling throttling keeps CPU available. Only do this if necessary, as it means you’ll be billed for CPU even when no requests are in progress. It’s useful if you have long-lived background tasks or if using something like FastAPI’s background tasks which continue after the response. If not needed, you can omit that annotation (or set it to true).
* `autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "50"` is an example to cap at 50 instances. Adjust as needed or remove it to use the platform default max (which is high, likely 1000).
* `serviceAccountName`: Very important – this specifies which IAM service account the code inside the container should run as. By default, if you don’t set it, Cloud Run uses the “default compute service account” of your project (which is often *project-number*@developer.gserviceaccount.com). It’s recommended to **create a dedicated service account** for your Cloud Run service (e.g. `cloud-run-agent-sa`) so you can control its permissions distinctly. We’ll discuss IAM roles in a moment. Set that here so your code can access GCP resources like BigQuery.

You don’t necessarily deploy using this JSON directly (usually one uses `gcloud run deploy` flags or a YAML), but it’s a useful reference for what needs to be configured. You can give such a template to an AI agent so it knows the structure of the Cloud Run service config.

## Database Integration (BigQuery and Supabase)

Your agent will interact with both **BigQuery** (a Google Cloud data warehouse) and **Supabase** (a hosted Postgres database). Here’s how to integrate each:

**1. Google BigQuery (GCP Data Warehouse)**
BigQuery is not a traditional OLTP database – it’s a analytics warehouse. It can handle huge datasets but has usage patterns and quotas (e.g. streaming inserts, query jobs). For integrating Cloud Run with BigQuery:

* **Use the BigQuery Python Client:** Google provides the `google-cloud-bigquery` Python library. It allows you to run SQL queries, stream inserts, etc., using your Cloud Run service account credentials automatically. In Cloud Run, authentication to GCP services works via **Application Default Credentials (ADC)** – since the code is running as a GCP service account, the BigQuery client can pick that up. For example, you can do:

  ```python
  from google.cloud import bigquery
  client = bigquery.Client()  # uses ADC credentials of the service account
  table_ref = client.dataset("mydataset").table("mytable")
  errors = client.insert_rows_json(table_ref, [{"name": "Alice", "score": 90}])
  if errors:
      logging.error(f"BigQuery insert errors: {errors}")
  ```

  This would stream a JSON row into BigQuery. Alternatively, you can assemble an SQL query and call `client.query(sql)` to run it. The key is that your Cloud Run service’s identity must have the right permissions in BigQuery (more on that below).

* **Service Account Permissions for BigQuery:** Make sure the Cloud Run service’s IAM service account has appropriate BigQuery roles. To **read/write data** in BigQuery, you typically need to grant at least:

  * **BigQuery Data Editor** on the specific dataset (or project) – this role allows read and write of table data. It includes permissions to create new tables, insert data, and read rows in that dataset.
  * **BigQuery User** (or Job User) at the project level – this allows the service account to run query jobs (which BigQuery executes in the background). In BigQuery, running queries or load jobs requires the ability to create jobs. For instance, *roles/bigquery.user* includes permission to create query jobs (bigquery.jobs.create).

  Essentially, give your service account *BigQuery Job User* permission to create queries, and *BigQuery Data Editor* (or Viewer if only reading) on the datasets it needs to use. This principle is outlined in Google’s docs and community answers: the Cloud Run service account needs BigQuery IAM roles to run jobs and access data. Without these, you’d get “access denied” errors when trying to use BigQuery.

* **Networking:** BigQuery is a Google service accessed over Google’s internal network. Your Cloud Run service just needs to have the BigQuery API enabled on the project (which it likely is). No special networking needed since it’s all within GCP.

* **Performance considerations:** If you are doing frequent small inserts into BigQuery (e.g., for each webhook event), note that BigQuery’s streaming inserts are eventually consistent and have a rate cost. BigQuery can handle hundreds of thousands of streaming inserts per minute, but each insert is slightly pricey. If the volume is huge, you might buffer data and load in batches (or consider an intermediary like Pub/Sub). For moderate volumes, direct inserts as shown above are fine.

* **Error handling:** Wrap BigQuery calls in try/except and log errors. For example, if `client.insert_rows_json` returns errors (list of errors per row), log them. If a query job fails, catch the exception. You can use Error Reporting (which we cover later) to track BigQuery exceptions as well.

**2. Supabase (Postgres) Databases**
Supabase is essentially a hosted PostgreSQL with extras. Integrating Cloud Run with Supabase is similar to using any external Postgres database:

* **Connection method:** You have two main options to talk to Supabase:
  a. **Using Supabase client libraries or REST:** Supabase provides client libraries (JS, maybe Python) and a RESTful API. For example, supabase’s REST API (via PostgREST) can be called with the supabase URL and an API key. In Python, you could use the `requests` library to call those endpoints.
  b. **Direct Postgres connection:** You can connect to the Supabase Postgres directly using psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy. Supabase gives you a connection string or host, port, user, password, and SSL requirements. For Python, you’d likely use `psycopg2` or `asyncpg` to connect and run SQL. This might be more flexible for complex queries.

* **Credentials:** Store the Supabase connection URL and service key in environment variables. Supabase typically provides an `API URL` and an `anon key` (for client access) and a separate `service role` key for admin access. Use the service role key on your backend if you need to bypass RLS or perform privileged operations. If you connect at the Postgres level, you’ll use the database credentials (user/password). These are definitely secrets – do not hardcode them. You might use **Secret Manager** to manage them and have Cloud Run load them as env vars securely.

* **Network and Security:** Supabase is external to GCP, accessed over the public internet (unless you’re running Supabase in a GCP VPC, but likely not). Ensure your Cloud Run has internet access (it does by default unless you severely restrict egress). If Supabase has IP whitelisting and you want to secure it, you’d need to use a VPC connector with static egress IP as discussed. Otherwise, just ensure you use SSL (Supabase requires TLS for DB connections by default).

* **Connection pooling:** A potential issue with serverless + Postgres is managing DB connections. Each Cloud Run instance will open a new connection to Postgres. If your traffic spikes and Cloud Run scales to many instances, you could overwhelm the DB with connections. Supabase might have connection limits. To mitigate this, enable connection pooling if Supabase offers it, or use a pooling proxy like PgBouncer (Supabase might have it built-in on the cloud side). At a code level, make sure to close connections when not in use, or use a global connection pool object rather than reconnecting every request. Given Cloud Run instances are reused for multiple requests, you can initialize a DB connection pool on startup and reuse it. For example, if using SQLAlchemy, create the engine globally when the container starts (outside the request handler) so that connections are reused.

* **Supabase usage:** If using the Supabase JS/Python client (which wraps the REST API), it often needs the Supabase URL and anon/service key. The Bootstrapped guide you found shows initializing supabase in code with those values. That would allow you to call Supabase’s insert/select functions easily. Alternatively, using direct SQL gives you full power of Postgres (you might prefer SQL for complex joins or using Supabase’s Postgres extensions). Either approach can work; just keep the logic consistent and handle errors (DB errors, constraint violations, etc.).

* **Example:** If using psycopg2, something like:

  ```python
  import psycopg2
  conn = psycopg2.connect(os.environ["SUPABASE_CONN_URL"])
  cur = conn.cursor()
  cur.execute("INSERT INTO leads(name,email) VALUES(%s,%s)", (name, email))
  conn.commit()
  cur.close()
  ```

  If using the Supabase client library (supabase-py), it would be more abstracted. Choose whatever you and your team are comfortable with.

**3. Other External Systems (Webhooks, n8n, Telegram, etc.)**
Your agent may need to **receive data from** and **send data to** various external systems: LeadProsper webhooks, affiliate postback URLs, partner APIs, n8n automation triggers, Telegram/Discord notifications, etc. Cloud Run can handle all of these since it can both serve HTTP and make outgoing HTTP requests:

* **Receiving Webhooks/HTTP calls:** For each external system that needs to send data in, you’ll expose an endpoint on Cloud Run. If you use a framework like Flask, you might create distinct routes (e.g. `/leadprosper_webhook` and `/partner_ping` etc.) to handle different payload formats. Alternatively, a single endpoint could inspect the payload or headers to distinguish sources. It’s often cleaner to separate them. Ensure you document these endpoints (method, expected auth or params) so that the external systems are configured correctly.

  * *Authentication & Security:* Many webhooks have an option to include a secret or token (e.g., a signature, or a known parameter) so you can verify the request is legitimate. If possible, use this. For instance, if LeadProsper can add a shared secret in the URL or an HMAC signature, have your code verify it before processing. This prevents random internet traffic from hitting your endpoint and confusing the agent. If no built-in mechanism, at least use an unguessable URL path.
  * *Idempotency:* Sometimes webhooks might retry or send duplicates. It’s wise to guard against processing the same event twice (perhaps by using an unique ID in the payload). Ensure your database operations can handle duplicates or use a de-dup logic if needed.
  * *Response:* Cloud Run will need to respond within a reasonable time. For webhooks, usually a 200 OK indicates success. If you need to do heavy processing, you might quickly queue the work (e.g., publish to Pub/Sub or push to a background task) and immediately return 200 to acknowledge receipt, then do the processing asynchronously. This way the external system isn’t kept waiting.

* **Outgoing HTTP calls:** Your agent might need to call external APIs (Supabase REST, n8n webhook URLs, Telegram bot API, Discord webhook URLs, etc.). Cloud Run allows outgoing requests freely (with internet egress). A few points:

  * Use the Python `requests` library or an async equivalent to make calls. Set reasonable timeouts on these calls (so your agent doesn’t hang forever if an external service is down).
  * Handle HTTP errors and transient failures. If a call to an external service fails (network error or non-200 response), decide on a retry policy. You might catch the exception and retry a few times, or if it’s non-critical, log an error and move on. Don’t let the entire Cloud Run request crash due to one failed outgoing call – handle it gracefully (perhaps return an error status to the initial caller if that’s appropriate, or just log it if it was a background notification).
  * **Webhook to n8n/Make.com:** If you want to trigger n8n or Make (Integromat), you’ll likely call a webhook URL that those services provide. Just treat it as a POST request in your code. If it’s critical to ensure the workflow runs, implement retries or have n8n send a response back.
  * **Telegram/Discord notifications:** You can integrate with these directly. For example, Telegram has a Bot API where you send an HTTP POST to `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendMessage` with chat ID and text. You could code that in your agent to send yourself or a group a message (for alerts or info). Discord webhooks have a specific URL to POST JSON payloads to a channel. These are straightforward HTTP calls. Again, secure the tokens and URLs (store as secrets) and handle errors (e.g., catch exceptions if the message send fails, maybe log and continue).
  * If you prefer not to bake this into the Cloud Run agent, an alternative is to use Cloud Monitoring alerts: for example, set up a log-based metric for errors and have an alert trigger a webhook to a service that relays to Telegram. But that’s more complex. Given you mentioned n8n and a dislike for Slack, a simpler path might be: Cloud Run does minimal alerts (or writes to a Pub/Sub on certain events) and n8n flows pick those up and forward to Telegram/WhatsApp. It’s up to your preferred architecture – Cloud Run is flexible enough to either do it directly or work with external automation.

* **Event-Driven triggers (Pub/Sub & Scheduler):** Besides direct HTTP webhooks, consider using Google Cloud Pub/Sub for internal asynchronous events. For instance, if a partner “ping” should trigger some heavy data processing that you don’t want to do synchronously, the Cloud Run service could publish a message to Pub/Sub, and you could have another Cloud Run service (or the same one, via a different endpoint) subscribed to that topic. Cloud Run integrates with Pub/Sub using push subscriptions. You’d create a subscription that pushes to your service’s URL. To secure it, you’d attach a service account to the subscription push so that it includes an OIDC token that Cloud Run will accept. (This is an advanced setup, but essentially Pub/Sub can auth when calling Cloud Run). Google’s sample shows creating a Pub/Sub subscription with a push endpoint and an OIDC token using a service account. This means you don’t have to allow public access for Pub/Sub; only Pub/Sub’s service account can invoke in that case.
  Similarly, Cloud Scheduler (for cron jobs) can trigger Cloud Run on a schedule. You can set up a Scheduler job to hit your endpoint every X minutes. This can use an OIDC token as well with a dedicated service account. This is useful for scheduled maintenance tasks, data cleanup, or periodic database syncs. If you have any tasks that need to run every so often (nightly, etc.), Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Run is a good pattern.

In summary, **Cloud Run can act as the central hub for data ingestion and distribution**: receiving webhooks, processing/enriching data (maybe querying BigQuery or writing to it), and then routing data out to other systems (like writing to Supabase, or triggering n8n scenarios, sending notifications). Design your Python agent with clear functions for each of these integration points, and use robust error handling and logging for each.

## Logging and Monitoring

Robust logging is crucial for visibility into your agent’s behavior, especially since you want this to be easily understandable by both humans and AI agents. Cloud Run is automatically integrated with **Google Cloud Logging (Stackdriver Logging)**. All `stdout` and `stderr` output from your container is collected as logs. Here’s how to leverage this:

* **Use Structured Logging:** Instead of just printing plain text, consider logging in **structured JSON** format. This allows Cloud Logging to parse fields (like severity, event details) which you can filter on. Google’s documentation provides examples of structured logging. For Python, you can simply print a JSON string. For instance, you might do:

  ```python
  import json, logging
  entry = {
      "severity": "INFO",
      "message": "Received lead payload",
      "source": "leadprosper",
      "lead_id": lead_id
  }
  print(json.dumps(entry))
  ```

  This will create a log entry with those fields. The special field `"severity"` will set the log level in Cloud Logging (so use `"ERROR"` for errors, etc.). You can include a trace or request ID if you have it, to correlate logs per request. Structured logs make it easier to query later (for example, you can query all logs where `source="leadprosper"`).

  Google Cloud’s Python logging library can also be used to send structured logs directly. But simply printing JSON as above or using Python’s `logging` with a custom formatter works too.

* **Standard Logging Practices:** Use `logging.info()`, `logging.error()`, etc., throughout your code to record key events. For instance, log when a webhook is received (maybe log the source and some identifier), log when you write to BigQuery (“inserted row into BQ”), log external API calls (“sent lead to partner X”), and log any exceptions or warnings. This will create a timeline in Cloud Logging that you can inspect. Make sure not to log sensitive data (PII or credentials) – mask or omit those. But do log enough to trace what happened.

* **Viewing Logs:** You can view logs in real-time in the Cloud Console (Logs Explorer), or use the `gcloud` CLI: for example, `gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=YOUR_SERVICE_NAME" --limit 100` will show recent logs. You can filter by severity (`severity>=ERROR` to see errors). This is useful for debugging when something goes wrong. The Cloud Run UI also has a “Logs” tab for each service where you can see logs correlated by request.

* **Error Reporting Integration:** Cloud Run automatically integrates with Cloud Error Reporting. If your code logs an exception stack trace to stderr or stdout, Error Reporting will aggregate it. For example, an uncaught exception that crashes your app (or a caught exception you manually log) will appear in Error Reporting with a stack trace. You can see a list of the top errors, how often they occur, etc., in the Error Reporting console. This is incredibly useful for catching issues over time.

* **Monitoring Metrics:** Cloud Run also emits metrics (like request count, latency, instance count). In Cloud Monitoring, you can set up dashboards or alerts. For instance, you could create an alert on “Cloud Run errors > X in 5 minutes” to notify you (perhaps via email or webhook). If you wanted to hook this into Telegram, you could have the alert call a Cloud Function or webhook that sends a Telegram message. There’s some assembly required, but it’s doable. Since you prefer Telegram for alerts, you might integrate via an intermediary (for example, an alert -> Pub/Sub -> your Cloud Run agent -> Telegram). This is an advanced setup; initially you might just watch the logs manually or have on-call alerts via email.

* **Robustness in Logging:** Implement **request logging** if possible – log an entry at the start of each request (with a request ID if available) and one at the end, so you know how long it took and the outcome. Cloud Run automatically logs HTTP request metadata (request method, path, response status, latency) which you can see in Logs Explorer. These are the **request logs**, and your `print` or app logs are **application logs** attached to them. If you print a structured log and include the trace ID, Cloud Logging will associate it under the request log for easy viewing. (Cloud Run passes a header `X-Cloud-Trace-Context`; Google’s docs show how to add that to logs for correlation. It’s a nice-to-have for complex systems.)

* **Testing and Validation:** After deploying your service, trigger some test webhooks or API calls and then **check the logs** to ensure everything is working. Logs will be your primary way to confirm that “agent X received data Y and successfully wrote to Z”. Encourage your team to regularly monitor logs, or set up alerts on anomalies.

In short, **log everything important**. With good logging, not only can humans debug issues, but you could even feed logs to an AI agent for analysis. For example, an AI ops agent could read the latest logs (via the Logging API) to determine what went wrong and suggest fixes. So, consistency and clarity in log messages will help both humans and AI.

## Error Handling and Reliability

Error handling goes hand-in-hand with logging. The goal is to make the system resilient and debuggable. Here are best practices:

* **Gracefully handle exceptions:** Wrap database calls, network requests, and main logic in try/except blocks. Any anticipated failure (like a DB insertion failure, an API timeout, a KeyError in parsing input) should be caught. When caught, log the error with details. If appropriate, return a safe error response to the caller. For example, if a webhook call fails due to bad input, you might return HTTP 400 with a message. If an internal processing fails, you might return 500. But **do not crash the container** if you can help it. Unhandled exceptions will crash that request and possibly the container instance, leading to a cold start next time. It’s better to catch the exception, log it, and let the request end gracefully. Cloud Run will keep the instance alive for future requests (in many cases) if you handle the error without crashing. Crashing the process leads to slower subsequent requests (cold start) and the risk of losing in-flight data.

* **Use HTTP response codes appropriately:** Cloud Run will return whatever your app responds with. So for external webhooks:

  * If you processed successfully, return 200 OK (or 201, 204 as fits).
  * If the input was invalid, return 400 Bad Request (with a message).
  * If an internal error happened (exception you couldn’t recover from), return 500 Internal Server Error.
    These status codes help the caller know what happened. Some webhook providers will retry on certain responses (e.g., LeadProsper might retry if it gets a 500 from you, assuming it’s a transient error). Check their docs; if they do retry on failure, ensure your code is idempotent (safe to run twice) to handle that.

* **Retries and Idempotency:** Cloud Run itself can retry requests in some cases. By default, if a container instance crashes or is overloaded, the request may be retried on another instance. You can configure maximum retries for your service (the default for HTTP is usually no retry on 4XX, but might retry on some 5XX). For outgoing calls (like to partner APIs), implement your own retry logic if needed. For example, if posting to Telegram fails due to a transient error, you might catch and retry after a few seconds. But also implement limits (don’t retry forever).
  For database operations, if you have a transaction that failed, decide if you can safely retry it or not. For instance, a uniqueness constraint violation shouldn’t be retried blindly without handling the cause. But a deadlock or network glitch could be retried. Using exponential backoff for retries is a good practice (retry after 1s, then 2s, etc., up to a limit). The `tenacity` Python library is useful for adding retries to functions, or you can code simple loops.

* **Transaction handling:** When interacting with databases (BigQuery or Postgres), consider using transactions where appropriate. For BigQuery, if you have a sequence of operations, you might not have multi-step transactions (BigQuery is eventually consistent for streaming inserts, but you could use one big query with multiple statements if needed). For Postgres (Supabase), use transactions if you need to ensure atomicity across multiple statements. Catch exceptions like `psycopg2.IntegrityError` to detect issues like duplicate records.

* **Testing error scenarios:** It’s helpful to simulate errors to see that your logging and recovery works. For example, temporarily point to an invalid BigQuery dataset to see the error log, or simulate a Supabase outage (perhaps by using wrong credentials) to ensure your code logs the connection failure and doesn’t hang indefinitely. This will give you confidence that when real issues occur, your agent will handle them gracefully.

* **Robustness for AI agent usage:** Since you mentioned feeding this to an AI agent, you might even produce machine-readable error reports. For example, if an error happens, you could log a structured JSON like: `{"severity":"ERROR","error_type":"BigQueryInsertError","details":"..."}**` which an AI could parse and decide on a course of action (maybe automatically notify someone or attempt a fix). This is an optional idea, but structuring errors can help later automation.

* **Timeouts and Circuit Breaking:** Set timeouts on external calls as mentioned. If an external dependency is very slow or down, you don’t want all your Cloud Run instances to hang and pile up. In worst case, implement a simple circuit breaker – e.g., if you notice 5 failures in a row calling API X, maybe stop calling it for a short period to avoid cascading failure. This can get complex, so at minimum log such repeated failures clearly.

In summary, **anticipate failures** in each part of the system (incoming data issues, database errors, outgoing HTTP failures) and handle them in code. This will make your Cloud Run service much more reliable and easier to maintain. Remember Google’s advice: *“You should handle errors and exceptions that occur during requests. Allowing such errors to crash your application process results in a cold start where a new container instance is started”*. So catch and handle exceptions whenever possible.

## Security, IAM, and Permissions

Security is vital in your Cloud Run setup, especially since you deal with database credentials and external access. Let’s break down a few areas:

**1. IAM for Cloud Run Service (Invoker Permissions):**
As discussed, if you want your Cloud Run service to be publicly accessible, you need to allow unauthenticated access. This is done by granting `roles/run.invoker` to `allUsers` on the service. You can do this via `gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding` or in the Console by checking “Unauthenticated invocations”. The Bootstrapped guide confirms enabling unauthenticated access to make the service publicly reachable. In IAM terms, it adds a policy binding like:

```json
{
  "role": "roles/run.invoker",
  "members": [
    "allUsers"
  ]
}
```

If you have some endpoints that should be private and some public, note that Cloud Run works at the service level for auth (you could deploy separate services for separate auth requirements, or use a custom authentication in-app). A simpler approach is often to keep sensitive admin endpoints separate (or secure them with an API key check within the code, for example).

**2. Service Account Roles (for accessing GCP services):**
We created a dedicated service account for the Cloud Run service (`YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` in the JSON template above). Now we must assign IAM roles to that service account so that it can do what it needs:

* **BigQuery Access:** As mentioned, assign **BigQuery Data Editor** on the relevant datasets or project, and **BigQuery User** at the project level (for job run permissions). This will allow the Cloud Run code to query and insert into BigQuery. If you only need read access, BigQuery Data Viewer would suffice instead of Editor. The principle of least privilege applies.

* **Secret Manager (if used):** If you decide to store your Supabase credentials or other secrets in Google Secret Manager (a good practice to avoid keeping secrets in env vars in plaintext), you’d grant the service account **Secret Manager Secret Accessor** role on those specific secrets. Cloud Run can directly mount secrets as environment variables or volumes if configured, and the service account needs permission to access them.

* **Cloud Storage or Other APIs:** If your agent will read/write files to Cloud Storage (for any reason), give Storage roles (e.g., Storage Object Admin/Viewer on a bucket). If it calls other Google APIs (Maps API, etc.), ensure those are enabled and credentials are in place.

* **Pub/Sub:** If you integrate with Pub/Sub (e.g., Cloud Run being triggered by Pub/Sub), there are a couple of service accounts in play. One is your Cloud Run’s own service account (which might publish messages – in that case give it Pub/Sub Publisher on a topic). Another is Pub/Sub’s *Push service account* (Google manages this when pushing to your service). In the sample for Pub/Sub integration, they create a dedicated service account “cloud-run-pubsub-invoker” and grant it Run Invoker on the service, then set that as the Pub/Sub subscription’s OIDC token service account. That way Pub/Sub calls to Cloud Run are authenticated. If you go this route, you’ll need to perform those IAM bindings (as Infrastructure as Code or manually). It’s somewhat advanced, but documentation is available.

* **Cloud Run Runtime Service Agent:** It’s worth noting that behind the scenes, Cloud Run uses a Google-managed service account (often named `<project-number>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`) as the “Cloud Run Service Agent” to manage resources. Ensure you don’t revoke its default permissions. This is usually handled automatically, but just be aware.

**3. Principle of Least Privilege:**
Grant your service account only the permissions it needs, and no more. For example, if the Cloud Run agent doesn’t need to manage GCP resources, it shouldn’t have Editor/Owner roles. Stick to specific roles like BigQuery User, etc. This limits blast radius if the code is compromised. Likewise, secure your Supabase keys – they give direct access to your database. Prefer the service role key (which bypasses RLS but is needed for full DB access) only in server context and keep it hidden.

**4. Encryption and Secrets:**
All traffic to Cloud Run is HTTPS, so inbound webhook data is encrypted in transit. For connecting to Supabase Postgres, use SSL if they provide (Supabase usually requires `sslmode=require`). Store secrets (DB passwords, API keys) in Secret Manager or at least as env vars in Cloud Run (which are encrypted at rest by Google). Avoid printing secrets in logs. You can also use tools like berglas or Docker secrets, but Secret Manager is easiest on GCP.

**5. Audit Logging:**
Cloud Run and IAM actions are logged in Cloud Audit Logs. If needed, you can review who invoked the service (if using auth) or who deployed new versions. Given you’ll have CI/CD, you might want to restrict who can deploy (maybe only via the CI service account). That means locking down Cloud Run Admin role to specific accounts. For instance, your CI service account has Cloud Run Admin, but regular developers might only have Cloud Run Viewer, etc., depending on your internal security needs.

**6. Team Access and Monitoring:**
Consider setting up Slack or Discord notifications for deployments or errors, if your team wants that (even if you don’t use Slack daily, a Slack channel just for system alerts could be useful – Slack has a rich API for alerts, but you could do the same with Discord which you prefer). Discord webhooks could receive Cloud Run alert info similarly. There are community tools and direct integrations for these. Since your preference is Telegram, you might end up writing a small Cloud Function that forwards alerts to Telegram via bot API. It’s up to how much time you want to invest in custom monitoring versus using existing solutions. A quick win could be using **Google Cloud’s built-in alerting** emailing a Google Group, which can ping your team’s emails/Telegram (if you use email-to-SMS or similar).

In short, **secure the edges** (public access only where needed, and authenticated access for internal triggers) and **secure the credentials** (limit IAM rights and keep secrets out of code). This will ensure your Cloud Run agent operates with minimum privileges necessary and reduces risk.

## Example Configuration Templates and Files for Agents

Finally, to help your AI agent (or configuration management) understand the system, here are some example JSON configurations and snippets that encode the above best practices. These can serve as reference "files" to feed to an agent:

* **Cloud Run Service Config (JSON Template):** *(As provided earlier in detail)* This JSON defines a Cloud Run service with proper settings (environment variables, CPU/memory, etc.). An AI agent could use this to know what API fields to set via the Cloud Run Admin API. For instance, an agent could fill in the `image` field with the latest image URI after a build, or adjust `env` values.

* **IAM Policy Binding (JSON) for Public Access:** To allow public (unauthenticated) access, an AI agent might apply a policy like:

  ```json
  {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "role": "roles/run.invoker",
        "members": ["allUsers"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  This would be merged into the service’s IAM policy. The agent could call the IAM API to set this policy, effectively doing what the Console’s “Allow unauth” does. (In practice, the agent should retrieve current bindings and add the allUsers principal).

* **Service Account Roles Manifest:** A JSON (or YAML) list of IAM roles to attach to the Cloud Run service account. For example:

  ```json
  {
    "serviceAccount": "cloud-run-agent-sa@yourproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "roles": [
      "roles/bigquery.dataEditor",
      "roles/bigquery.user",
      "roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
    ]
  }
  ```

  This isn’t an official format, but it’s a structured way to communicate what permissions the service account needs. An AI agent could read this and then use the IAM API to ensure those roles are granted on the appropriate resources.

* **Logging Query Example:** A JSON snippet to illustrate using Logging API might help the AI agent fetch logs. For instance:

  ```json
  {
    "resourceNames": ["projects/your-project-id"],
    "filter": "resource.type=\"cloud_run_revision\" AND resource.labels.service_name=\"YOUR_SERVICE_NAME\" AND severity>=ERROR",
    "orderBy": "timestamp desc",
    "pageSize": 10
  }
  ```

  This would be the body for `entries:list` method in Cloud Logging API to get the last 10 error logs from your service. An AI ops agent could use such a query to retrieve logs for analysis.

* **Webhook Endpoint Documentation (JSON):** You might even encode the expected webhook schema for the agent. E.g.:

  ```json
  {
    "endpoint": "/leadprosper_webhook",
    "method": "POST",
    "expects": { "lead_id": "string", "name": "string", "email": "string", ... },
    "returns": { "status": "ok" }
  }
  ```

  Such documentation in JSON could help an AI understand what data to provide or what output to expect. This is more for completeness if you anticipate AI-driven testing or integration.

Using structured representations like the above can indeed make it easier to “teach” an AI agent about the Cloud Run deployment and operations. It can reason over the JSON rather than free-form docs.

**Sources:** The information and best practices above are drawn from official Google Cloud documentation and recent updates. Cloud Run’s GitHub Actions deployment process and required IAM roles are documented by Google. Guidance on configuring Cloud Run (memory, concurrency, CPU, ingress) is from Cloud Run’s official reference. We referenced Google’s Cloud Run docs on allowing unauthenticated access, and error handling recommendations from Cloud Run’s Error Reporting integration (to avoid crashes that cause cold starts). For BigQuery, Google’s community and documentation highlight assigning BigQuery User and Data Editor roles to the service account so it can create jobs and edit data. The logging section follows Google Cloud guidance on structured logging for Cloud Run.

By following this comprehensive guide, you should be able to deploy your Python-based agent on Cloud Run with confidence. You’ll have a clear understanding of whether to use GitHub for CI/CD (yes, in most cases), how to configure the service correctly, and how to implement robust logging, error handling, and integrations with both GCP and external systems. This setup will enable your agent to interact with BigQuery, Supabase, and various webhooks reliably, while also making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot via logs and possibly even AI assistance in the future. Good luck with your Cloud Run deployment!

## 1. Overview of Cloud Run

* **Type**: Serverless, containerized
* **Invoke**: HTTPS (public) or authenticated via IAM
* **Scale**: 0 → N instances, concurrency per instance configurable
* **Stateless**: Local disk and memory wiped between cold starts
* **Triggers**: HTTP, Pub/Sub, Cloud Scheduler (via EventArc)

            "env": [
              { "name": "SUPABASE_URL", "value": "https://xyz.supabase.co" },
              { "name": "SUPABASE_KEY", "value": "•••" },
              { "name": "BIGQUERY_DATASET", "value": "analytics" }
            ],
            "resources": {
              "limits": { "cpu": "1", "memory": "512Mi" }

## 4. IAM & Permissions

### 4.1 Service Account Roles

```json
{
  "serviceAccount": "agent-sa@PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "roles": [
    "roles/run.invoker",              // if authenticated only
    "roles/bigquery.user",
    "roles/bigquery.dataEditor",
    "roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
  ]
}
```

### 4.2 Public Invoker Binding

```json
{
  "resource": "projects/PROJECT/locations/us-central1/services/agent-service",
  "binding": {
    "role": "roles/run.invoker",

## 5. Database Integrations

### 5.1 BigQuery Client Sample (Python)

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
client = bigquery.Client()  # ADC via agent-sa
errors = client.insert_rows_json(
  client.dataset("analytics").table("leads"),
  [{"lead_id": "123", "email": "x@y.com"}]
)
if errors:
    print({"severity":"ERROR","error_type":"BQInsert","details":errors})
```

### 5.2 Supabase (Postgres) Connection (psycopg2)

```python
import os, psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect(os.environ["SUPABASE_CONN_URL"])
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute(
  "INSERT INTO leads(id,email) VALUES(%s,%s)",
  (lead_id, email)
)
conn.commit()
```

## 6. Webhook & Event Handling

```json
[
  {
    "endpoint": "/webhook/leadprosper",
    "method": "POST",
    "auth": "HMAC-SHA256 header",
    "schema": {
      "lead_id": "string",
      "first_name": "string",
      "email": "string"
    },
    "response": {"status": "ok"}
  },
  {
    "endpoint": "/webhook/partner",
    "method": "POST",
    "auth": "none",
    "schema": {"event":"string","payload":"object"},
    "response": {"received": true}
  }
]
```

### 6.1 Pub/Sub Push Subscription (Optional)

```bash
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create agent-sub \
  --topic=agent-topic \
  --push-endpoint=https://agent-service-…run.app/psub \
  --push-auth-service-account=pubsub-invoker@PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

## 7. Logging & Monitoring

### 7.1 Structured Log Example

```json
{
  "severity": "INFO",
  "message": "Processed leadprosper webhook",
  "lead_id": "123",
  "duration_ms": 125
}
```

### 7.2 Error Reporting & Queries

```json
{
  "filter": "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND severity=ERROR",
  "orderBy": "timestamp desc",
  "pageSize": 20
}
```

## 8. CI/CD & Agent-Friendly JSON Snippets

* **Deploy Config** → Section 2 JSON blocks
* **IAM Assignments** → Section 4 JSON blocks
* **Service Definition** → Section 3 JSON block
* **Webhook Specs** → Section 6 JSON array
* **Log Queries** → Section 7 JSON blocks

---

### How an AI Agent Might Use This

1. **Read** the JSON under **Section 2** to decide how to build & deploy.
2. **Apply** IAM roles from **Section 4** via the IAM API.
3. **Create** or update the Cloud Run Service using **Section 3** JSON.
4. **Register** Pub/Sub or Scheduler triggers with the CLI snippet.
5. **Fetch** logs using **Section 7** queries to monitor errors.
6. **Invoke** endpoints defined in **Section 6** to validate webhooks.

All key config and sample code is now machine-readable, with clear section labels and JSON blocks.
